BAS 475 Group Stocks Project

We started off by creating a dashboard with four different tabs displaying each of our four features our Shiny App can do. The first feature titled "Stock Selection" allows you to type in a company name and find its corresponding stock ticker. This makes the other features much easier to use. The second feature titled "Stock Prices Graphic" allows you to select a stock using its ticker and view its prices over a date range that the user inputs. A plot is displayed and gives you the option to log the y axis to make it appear more normal. The third feature titled "Volume Graphic" allows you to select a stock using its ticker and view the volume it was traded over time within a date range the user inputs.The fourth feature titled "Stock Percent Change" allows you to select two stocks using their tickers and compare the percent changed over a date range specified by the user.
